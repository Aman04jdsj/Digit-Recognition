  ## Installation
  
  *Steps required to install project and how to get the development environment running:*
  
  Clone the repository. Run "python3 mnist_csv3.py" to extract the mnist.pkl.gz into test_image.csv, test_label.csv, train_image.csv and train_label.csv.
  
  ## Usage 
  
  *Instructions and examples for use:*
  
  Run "python3 NeuralNetwork3.py train_image.csv train_label.csv test_image.csv" to perform the training and make predictions. The predictions will be in the test_predictions.csv file. Then run "python3 accuracy.py" which prints the accuracy of the predictions.
